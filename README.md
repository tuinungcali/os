# Wolfi

This is the main package repository for the Wolfi project.a

Named after the [smallest octopus][wiki-ow], [Wolfi][wolfi] is a lightweight GNU
software distribution which is designed around minimalism, making it
well-suited for containerized environments built with [apko][apko].

It is built using [melange][melange], and is sponsored by [Chainguard][cg],
which uses it to provide [lightweight GNU/Linux runtime images][cgi].

The Wolfi APK package repository is located at https://packages.wolfi.dev/os and the signing public key is at https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/wolfi-signing.rsa.pub.

## Getting Started

A full guide is available on the [org page](https://github.com/wolfi-dev), but the quickest way to try out Wolfi is with the
[wolfi-base image](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/wolfi-base):

```
docker run -it cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base
52aace776b20:/# uname -a
Linux 52aace776b20 5.15.49-linuxkit-pr #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu May 25 07:27:39 UTC 2023 aarch64 Linux
52aace776b20:/# cat /etc/os-release
ID=wolfi
NAME="Wolfi"
PRETTY_NAME="Wolfi"
VERSION_ID="20230201"
HOME_URL="https://wolfi.dev"
```

## Mixing packages with other distributions

Mixing packages with other distributions is not supported and can create security problems. Although both Wolfi and Alpine use the apk package manager, packages are not compatible with each other.

## If Wolfi is missing a package you require

Wolfi is not currently intended to be a general purpose desktop operating system. Our priority is to provide packages
that enable containerized and embedded system workflows. Please keep this in mind when proposing adding packages to
Wolfi. Also note that some packages may not be appropriately licensed for inclusion.  FSF or OSI approved [licenses](https://spdx.org/licenses/) are ideal.

Wolfi also aims to keep its package set as up-to-date with security patches as possible. It is a requirement that any 
package/version contributed to Wolfi has an actively maintained upstream. 

To request inclusion of a package into Wolfi please use our [New Package Request Template](https://wolfi.dev/os/issues/new/choose).
